Obsidian is a powerful tool for writing, thinking, and organizing your knowledge — all using simple Markdown files stored locally on your device.

It’s not just a notes app. Obsidian lets you:
- Link your ideas and notes together
- Create your own personal knowledge base
- Extend features using plugins (like the ones in this vault)
- Maintain full ownership of your data (no cloud required)

## 🧱 How Does It Work?

### 🗂 Vaults
An Obsidian **vault** is just a folder on your computer that holds your notes. This tutorial itself is a vault, and you’re learning by exploring and editing it.

### 📝 Notes
All notes are plain text `.md` files. You can edit them in Obsidian or any other Markdown editor.

### 🔗 Linking
The real power comes from linking notes together using `[[double brackets]]`. This creates a web of connected ideas.

### 🧩 Plugins
Obsidian has optional plugins to extend functionality. This vault uses:
- ✅ **Tasks**: manage todos with filters and priorities
- 📊 **DataView**: display notes or tasks as lists, tables, etc.
- 📋 **Kanban**: create boards for projects and workflows
- 🔗 **Paste URL into Selection**: quickly turn text into links
