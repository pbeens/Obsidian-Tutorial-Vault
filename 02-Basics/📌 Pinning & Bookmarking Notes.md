As your vault grows, you'll likely return to certain notes repeatedly—like dashboards, task lists, or weekly reviews.

Obsidian provides two methods to keep these notes easily accessible:

- **Pinning** keeps a note open in its tab.
- **Bookmarking** adds it to a sidebar list for quick access.

## 📌 Pinning Notes

Pinning a note locks it in place so it doesn't close when you open something else.

To pin a note:

1. Open the note in a tab.
2. Right-click the tab title at the top.
3. Select **"Pin"** from the menu.

A small pin icon will appear on the tab, indicating it's pinned.

> *Tip*: You can have multiple pinned tabs open simultaneously!

## 🔖 Bookmarking Notes

In Obsidian v1.2 and later, the **Starred** plugin has been replaced by the more versatile **Bookmarks** feature. Bookmarks allow you to save and organize various items, including notes, folders, searches, and more.

To bookmark a note:

1. Open the note you want to bookmark.
2. Click the **three-dot menu (•••)** in the top right corner of the note.
3. Select **"Add to bookmarks."**.

To access your bookmarks:

- Click the **Bookmarks** icon (![[Pasted image 20250625144633.png|10]]) at the top of the left sidebar. 
- If the icon isn't visible, open the **Command Palette** (press `Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P` on macOS), type **"Show Bookmarks,"** and select the command.

> *Note*: You can organize bookmarks into groups, reorder them via drag-and-drop, and bookmark various items like folders, searches, and headings.
