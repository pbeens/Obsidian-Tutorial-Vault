One of Obsidian’s most powerful features is the ability to link notes together using simple double square brackets. These are called **WikiLinks**.

When you type `[[`, Obsidian will suggest matching note titles as you type. Linking notes helps you build a connected knowledge system — kind of like your own personal wiki.

## 🔄 Example

Let’s say you have a note called:

```
Goals for 2025
```

In any other note, you can type:

```
See [[Goals for 2025]] for more context.
```

- If the note already exists, the link will take you there.
- If the note doesn’t exist yet, Obsidian will create it automatically when you click the link.

## 🧠 Why Link Notes?

- Connect ideas naturally as you write
- Create a web of related thoughts
- Track sources, references, or project dependencies
- Use `backlinks` to see which notes reference the current one

## 🏁 Task: Try It

- [ ] Create a new note called `Things I Want to Learn`
- [ ] In another note, type `[[Things I Want to Learn]]`
- [ ] Ctrl-click (or Cmd-click on Mac) to follow the link
