As your notes grow, you'll want a way to keep things tidy. Obsidian gives you two main tools for this: **folders** and **tags**.

## 🗂 Folders

Folders are just regular directories on your computer. You can:

- Drag and drop notes between folders
- Create subfolders to group topics
- Right-click in the file explorer to **create new folders**
  Use folders for:
- Broad topic areas (e.g., `Projects`, `Journal`, `People`)
- Separating active vs archived notes
- Keeping plugin files (like templates) in their own space

---

## 🏷 Tags

Tags are keywords that begin with `#`. You can put them **anywhere** in your note — top, bottom, or inline.
Example:

> Discussed next steps. #work
> #meeting

Use tags to:

- Mark notes across folders (like `#priority`)
- Group similar types (e.g., `#book`, `#quote`)
- Build dashboards with DataView later on

---

## 🏁 Task: Organize a Bit

- Create a folder called `Projects`
- Move a note into that folder
- Add a tag like `#learning` to a note
