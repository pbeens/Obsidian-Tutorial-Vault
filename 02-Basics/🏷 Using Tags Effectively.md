Tags are a quick way to organize and find notes across your vault — no folder needed. In Obsidian, any word that begins with a `#` becomes a tag.
You can put tags:

- At the top of a note (like metadata)
- At the bottom (like a quick label)
- Or even in the middle of a sentence

## 🏷 Example

```markdown
# Packing List

#travel #checklist

- Passport
- Chargers
- Snacks
```

Now, if you search for `#travel` in Obsidian’s tag pane, you’ll find this note.

## 🤔 When to Use Tags (vs Folders)

Use **tags** when:

- You want to group notes that live in different folders (e.g., `#priority`)
- You want quick filtering (e.g., `#idea`, `#book`, `#meeting`)
- You don’t want to move files around

Use **folders** when:

- You need structural organization (e.g., separate folders for clients or projects)
- You want to keep plugin-related files out of the way
  You can combine both for best results!

## 🔍 Where to View Your Tags

To see a list of all the tags in your vault:

1. Open the **right sidebar** in Obsidian.
2. Look for the **Tags icon** — it looks like two small luggage tags, one overlapping the other.
